# Discussion Board

## Proposals / Discussion

Create an issue in GitHub, it can be discussed in the issue, and then a
decision taken in a meeting if necessary.

## Meeting minutes / Decisions

Create a markdown file with the date `DD.md` as the name, under the
correct directory `YYYY/MM`.

Raise a PR to get it approved and/or discussed, and finally merged from
some of the meeting participants.

See [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md).
